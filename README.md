Mock Ecommerce Website
=======================

This project shows a fake online store in which users can pick out items with a desired quantity and put it in their shopping cart. The shopping cart allows users to apply a discount code which will give a 10% discount, adjust quantity of items, and delete items. The purpose of this project was to allow me to practice using React.js, using a React Router, fetching data, react testing, and styling react components.
